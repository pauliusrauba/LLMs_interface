# langchain_demo
Combining custom tools with an external LLMs using langchain.

To get this up and running:

1. Set up an OpenAI api key and add it to apikey.py as "apikey"
2. Open streamlit via "streamlit run app_cvd.py"

Note: you don't really need to upload "person.csv" on streamlit, internally the function simply reads the data from the local directory.
